# # Sum square difference
# # Problem 6 
# # The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# # 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
# # The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

# # (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
# # Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# # Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## It: it seems a little faster than C code in this way
